Notes:

* Good reference here: https://github.com/rgl/macos-vagrant
* in particular zeroing out the empty space so the box is smaller
* Other places to trim:
  *  /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms
    * whole bunch of platforms we don't need (IOS, Watch, AppleTV, iPhoneSimulator)
